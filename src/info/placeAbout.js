    about:
      "Founded by Bartolomé Columbus in 1496, the city of Santo Domingo was almost completely built during the 16th century. Firstly located on the east bank of the Ozama River, it was the first city built by the spaniards during the American continent. Despite this, in 1502 it was moved to the west side of the river by the command of Nicolás de Ovando, governor of La Española at the time, thus founding the new city of Santo Domingo de Guzmán. Some time later, in 1507, the city obtained the Royal Statute of being the first European city located in the New World.",

      "Bahía de las Águilas (Eagles' Bay) is located inside Jaragua National Park, in the western end of Pedernales province. One of the Dominican Republic’s most beautiful beaches is located there. It is a protected area in where it is possible to explore a completely virgin zone to where only a few paths arrive, and where there are not any facilities of any kind. It is an ideal setting for adventure and ecotourism lovers. Even though camping is not allowed inside the protected areas, some other activities can be carried out, for example, trekking, biking or just swimming in some of the Caribbean region’s most crystalline waters for a refreshing bath.",

      "Live Punta Cana to the fullest with its incredible beaches, hotels, and many activities designed to make your holidays a tropical dream. Located in Cabo Engaño, the easternmost area of Dominican Republic, Punta Cana has become one of the most touristic areas for its offer of all-included resorts. The construction of these hotels was designed in such a way that it mostly blends with the landscape, enhancing the feeling of an open space and enriching the tropical experience. Punta Cana is kind of isolated from the other towns of the area, being Playa Bávaro the only neighboring town. Despite all this, you can still go on trips to different spots such as Isla Saona, Catalinita, or Este National Park, where you can hike the sendero ecológico or visit the Padre Nuestro Archaeological site.",
